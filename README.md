# Media Gallery

**MediaGallery** is a decentralized application (DApp) library to upload and share media assets on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Inspiration:
* I am a frequent user of Instagram, so I thought I would try to create an application that allowed users to share media.
* One by product of sharing media on the blockchain is you have authenticity built in, in the sense that you know that the media was provided by an address, and that the media hasn't been changed since they provided it (via a multi-hash).

More to come...
